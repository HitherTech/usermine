About
-----

usermine.py analyzes a user, returning a summary of what they've commented
on and URLs contained in their comments.

It works by:

1) Downloading the user's comment history from one or more services
2) Going through the comments and submitting them to the Calais web service
3) Summarizing the semantic data returned by Calais

Results are stored in a database file.

Installation
------------

The script requires python-calais, which can be found at:

Example
-------

usermine.py -u mcantelon -a abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx
